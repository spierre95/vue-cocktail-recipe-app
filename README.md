# vue-cocktail-recipe-app

![analytics](./screenshots/cocktail_app.png?raw=true)

### Thought Process

My thought process behind this test was to create an app that can be built upon in the future. I tried to make everything modular and reusable. I tried to implement solutions in a way that would allow me to expand upon the project in the future. This may have backfired, as I spent too much time focusing on things that aren't as important for a project this size with a time constraint. 

### Next Steps

- Refine Search process ( clear search results, add pagination etc. )
- Normalize data from api
- Add share button to the card 
- Add a details page for each recipe ( due to time constraints I was not able to fully add this feature )
- Update header styles ( add icons, change colour etc. )
